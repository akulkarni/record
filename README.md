Record
======

_Write messages to your future self._

Prepare. Act. Reflect.

That's how I've tried to live my life. Prepare for major decisions, Act on them, and then Reflect on how things went and how they could have gone better.

Except that I realized that I don't really Reflect. That I spend too much time going from Prepare --> Act --> Prepare --> Act.

I don't like that.

That's where Record comes in. It asks you a simple, reflective question every day. 

For example,
- If you were to relive today, what would you do differently?
- What was the most important thing you did today?
- Whose life did you impact the most today?

Answers are encrypted and stored. So you can think of this like a daily diary.

Still a WIP. Feedback welcome.
